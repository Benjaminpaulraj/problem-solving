# Binary Trees

* Root:
> A node that has no parent. 

* Leaf:
> A node with no descendants. 

* Depth:
> The depth of node n is the number of nodes on the search path from the root to n, not including the n itself.

* Height:
> The height of a binary tree is the maximum depth of any node in that tree. 

* Full Binary Tree:   
> A binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children. 

* Perfect Binary Tree:
> A Full Binary Tree in which all leaves are at same depth. 

* Complete Binary Tree:   
> A Binary Tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
